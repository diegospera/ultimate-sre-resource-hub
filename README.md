## What is SRE?

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that applies software engineering principles to operations, treating infrastructure and operations as software problems. Originating at Google in 2003 by Ben Treynor Sloss, SRE focuses on creating scalable, reliable systems through automation and data-driven practices.

From the Lexicon ([Section 1](SRE_Lexicon.md#section-1-defining-site-reliability-engineering-beyond-ops-with-software-engineers)):

- **Core Definition**: SRE maintains availability, performance, and efficiency to enhance customer experience and enable safe innovation. It's not just "keeping the lights on"â€”it's a value-generating function that automates toil and quantifies reliability via SLOs and error budgets.
- **SRE vs. DevOps**: SRE is a prescriptive implementation of DevOps, adding tools like error budgets for shared ownership.
- **Strategic Value**: Transforms reliability into a business competency, saving costs through efficiency and risk management.

- **In Simple Terms**: SRE is ops with a developer's mindsetâ€”coding to prevent outages.

## SRE vs. DevOps vs. Platform Engineering

SRE differentiates by focusing on engineering practices for reliability, while overlapping with DevOps culture and platform engineering tools.

### Comparison Table (Expanded from Lexicon Insights)

| **Role**                 | **Primary Focus**                         | **Key Responsibilities**                                                  | **Unique Traits**                             | **Lexicon Tie-In**                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SRE**                  | Reliability through engineering           | Define SLOs/error budgets, automate toil, incident response, embrace risk | Quantifies unreliability; balances innovation | [Section 1 & 3](SRE_Lexicon.md#section-1-defining-site-reliability-engineering-beyond-ops-with-software-engineers) |
| **DevOps**               | Collaboration for fast, reliable delivery | CI/CD pipelines, silo-breaking, automation                                | Cultural philosophy; end-to-end ownership     | SRE operationalizes DevOps                                                                                         |
| **Platform Engineering** | Internal platforms for dev productivity   | Self-service IaC, APIs, DX tools                                          | Abstracts complexity; enables scalability     | Supports SRE topologies                                                                                            |

- **Key Differences**: SRE treats ops as software (e.g., automating releases); DevOps is cultural; Platform Engineering builds foundations (e.g., Kubernetes platforms).
- **Overlaps**: All emphasize automation and observability.
- **How They Fit**: DevOps sets culture, Platform provides tools, SRE ensures reliability.

## Core Principles of SRE

From [Section 2](SRE_Lexicon.md#section-2-the-foundational-pillars-of-sre-a-deep-dive-into-the-seven-core-principles), the seven interconnected principles:

1. **Embracing Risk**: Quantify and manage risk, not eliminate itâ€”use error budgets.
2. **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**: Measurable, user-centric targets (e.g., 99.9% availability).
3. **Eliminating Toil**: Automate manual, repetitive work; cap at 50% time.
4. **Monitoring**: Three pillarsâ€”metrics, logs, tracesâ€”for observability.
5. **Automation**: Primary tool for scaling and consistency.
6. **Release Engineering**: Fast, safe processes like canaries.
7. **Simplicity**: Reduce complexity to boost reliability.

These form a holistic frameworkâ€”see [Section 3](SRE_Lexicon.md#section-3-embracing-risk-the-counter-intuitive-core-of-reliability-and-innovation) for risk management details.
